### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer based in Singapore. My primary focus is on backend systems but I am also familiar with frontend development frameworks such as React.js. I am really passionate about learning and applying new technologies in both my personal projects as well as work related projects. 

### Current Projects
A event management system with a backend powered by Django Rest Framework, a Telegram Bot for users and an Admin Portal powered by React
