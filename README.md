### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer based in Singapore. My primary focus is on backend systems but I am also familiar with frontend development frameworks such as React.js. I am really passionate about learning and applying new technologies in both my personal projects as well as work related projects. 

### Current Project
1. A event management system with a backend powered by Django Rest Framework, a Telegram Bot for users and an Admin Portal powered by React

- [Backend](https://github.com/yankai14/event-management-telegram-bot-backend)<br/>
- [Admin Portal](https://github.com/yankai14/event-management-admin-portal)<br/>
- [Telegram Bot](https://github.com/yankai14/event-management-telegram-bot-client)

2. NTU Stars Bot. A bot that uses selenium in order to help students get their modules during course registration.
